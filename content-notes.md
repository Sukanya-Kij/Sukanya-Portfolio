# Content Notes (Resume Reconciliation)

Source files:

Normalization decisions:
1. Work history and timeline use the latest aligned wording from the two resumes:
   - SGS Thailand Ltd. | Customer Relationship Management Officer | Nov 2021 - Present
   - San E.68 Consulting Engineers Co., Ltd. | Chemist | Aug 2021 - Nov 2021
2. English proficiency differs between versions ("intermediate" in older Thai resume context vs "Professional Working Proficiency" in newer English resume). The site displays Professional Working Proficiency and retains a note for transparency.
3. Address fields differ in extracted text formatting and are excluded from public content by privacy policy (email-only display).
4. Quantified claims included on the site are only those present in resume text:
   - Renewal retention > 90%
   - CRM Auto-Alert reduced repetitive work by > 30%
   - Top Sale Award (2 consecutive years)
   - Team Innovation Award
